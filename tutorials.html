                <p>This is the page where I keep some basic tutorials and additional information relating to
                    other
                    resources I have on this site. Each section will have a 'Notable Resources' section that
                    will link
                    to pages with supplemental information that I recommend looking into. Not all of it is
                    information
                    that you will strictly need, but can give a lot of extra context to help you get more
                    comfortable
                    with coding or interacting with code. Above all else, I recommend either taking or watching
                    a crash
                    course on basic HTML and CSS before trying to code on Lioden just to get yourself more
                    familiar. I
                    found that was a great jumping off point myself when I started coding on LD years ago.</p>

                    <p>Coding my den boxes is very simple. The most you will need is a background color, text
                        color, and
                        border, so let's break those down individually as well as look at the style attribute so
                        you can
                        understand how each part works and then put it all together.</p>
                    <h4>Style Attribute</h4>
                    <p>The style attribute lets you directly style an element as its name suggests. To do so all
                        you
                        have to do is add it. Let's use one of my den boxes as an example so you can see it in
                        context.
                    </p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="bigBox"<span class="highlight"> style=""</span>>TEXT HERE&lt;/div></p>
                    <p>This is the Big Box on my Hover Box layout. If you look at the highlighted section, you
                        can see
                        the style attribute that I'm talking about. This attribute tells the browser any styling
                        information that isn't already included in any of the CSS on your page. By adding that
                        style=""
                        bit to any element you can change all kinds of things about it, but we'll just focus on
                        what you
                        need.</p>
                    <h4>Background-Color Property</h4>
                    <p>The first thing you'll want is the background-color. I recommend setting it to a color
                        that is
                        already on the page or something at a similar value. So if the layout is dark, opt for a
                        dark
                        color for your boxes. This causes less text issues.</p>
                    <p>To begin, you'll need a basic understanding of the formatting of CSS, which goes <span
                            class="highlight">property: value;</span> including the semi-colon as that's what
                        the
                        browser uses as like commas in a worded list. You tell your friend you like blue, green,
                        and
                        purple, coders tell the page that they want background-color: pink; color: black;
                        border: none;
                        which will make more sense soon, so I'll give you an example using the same box from the
                        previous section.</p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="bigBox" style="<span class="highlight">background-color:
                            #006600;</span>">TEXT
                        HERE&lt;/div></p>
                    <p>I know that might look like a big jump, but let's break it down. background-color is the
                        property
                        we're wanting to change, and #006600 is the value, which matches the formatting
                        mentioned
                        earlier. Why does the value look different than before? Why isn't it a color? It
                        actually is a
                        color. That is a color written in what's called hex (stay with me here lol). You can
                        find the
                        hexcode for any color using most basic color-picking programs as well at the HTML Color
                        Names
                        page I linked in the Notable Resources box. It has valid color names that you can use as
                        is
                        without a hexcode and if you click Color Picker you can edit the color and it gives you
                        the
                        hexcode for that new color. Hexcodes will always be six digits for a solid color
                        following a #
                        symbol.</p>
                    <p>Putting these together tells the browser that you want the box to have a background that
                        is
                        #006600, which also happens to be the same dark green I use to highlight.</p>
                    <h4>Color Property</h4>
                    <p>This one is a bit confusing if you're new to HTML and CSS, but the property to change the
                        text
                        color is just called color. I know, I don't like it either, but it's been that way so
                        long that
                        changing across the entirety of the web would be a nightmare. Let's say you want to
                        change the
                        text of something to be white. You could use either just white as the value or its
                        hexcode which
                        is #ffffff. Let me show you.</p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="bigBox" style="background-color: #006600;<span class="highlight"> color:
                            #ffffff;</span>">TEXT HERE&lt;/div></p>
                    <p>Here you can see that just like before there's still that background-color property
                        making the
                        box dark green, but now there's also the color property telling the browser you want the
                        text
                        inside to be white. Hard to read black text on a dark green background, after all. If
                        that seems
                        super simple, awesome! That means this tutorial is doing its job. If not, just remember
                        the
                        formatting for this, property: value; that lets the browser know what you want to change
                        and how
                        you want to change it using the style attribute.</p>
                    <h4>Border Property</h4>
                    <p>This one is slightly more complicated than the previous two properties. While
                        background-color
                        and color only typically take a single value, the border property is a shorthand
                        property which
                        means you can give it multiple values as long as they're in the correct order. Don't
                        worry,
                        though, because all we're going to be giving it is the width, style, and color of the
                        border.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the final part of the example, let's say you want a thin, solid border that's white.
                        Simple
                        enough, right? Exactly. Let me show you what that would look like.</p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="bigBox" style="background-color: #006600; color: #ffffff;<span class="highlight">
                            border: 1px solid #ffffff;</span>">TEXT HERE&lt;/div></p>
                    <p>You can see that in the border property it has a value of 1px solid #ffffff which means
                        that the
                        border will be 1px wide, solid in style, and #ffffff as in white in color. You want
                        something
                        different? Then all you'd need to do is swap it out! You want a pink box with a 4px
                        thick dashed
                        border and black borders and text?</p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="bigBox" style="background-color: pink; color: black; border: 4px dashed
                        black;">TEXT HERE&lt;/div></p>
                    <p>Or maybe a black box with white text and no border?</p>
                    <p>&lt;div class="bigBox" style="background-color: black; color: white; border: none;">TEXT
                        HERE&lt;/div></p>
                    <p>Like I said, as long as you follow the formatting, it's all just giving the browser a
                        list of
                        what you want. Once you've got the hang of it, any changes will be super easy to do.
                        I've also
                        linked in the Notable Reseources box the w3schools pages for the style attribute and
                        border
                        styles in case you still had any questions in regards to either. That website is a great
                        resource for any HTML or CSS questions you might have.</p>

                    <p class="pt-2">When it comes to choosing a background image, it is much different from
                        choosing an
                        image for a CSS
                        layout. In this case, smaller is better. What you'll want for the best results I've
                        found is a
                        small, smoothly repeatable image. I find that the best places to find those are through
                        fabric
                        websites (I like to look at cotton fabrics since they usually have a super wide array of
                        options)
                        and
                        pattern generaters. Since you <em>shouldn't</em> be using these for commissions, there's
                        less to
                        worry about when it comes to things like copyright, but I still avoid copyrighted
                        material as a
                        rule
                        of thumb. Simple repeating patterns with only one or two main
                        colors are typically the easiest to work with. From there, you'll just need to
                        screenshot the
                        portion you want repeated, resize it down a
                        bit
                        if necessary, host it somewhere, and then it's ready to be linked as your background
                        image.</p>
                    <p>That's really the toughest part of making a template. The rest is just the repetitive
                        process of
                        replacing any of the colors, fonts, and borders with what you want, which becomes easier
                        and
                        easier
                        the more practice you get.</p>
                    <p>Although, it's also important to keep in mind how fonts work on Lioden forums. You can't
                        import
                        any
                        fonts onto your threads, so your best bet is to stick to what are called Web Safe Fonts.
                        But
                        choosing a web safe font still doesn't guarantee it'll work for everyone who views your
                        thread.
                        For
                        example, Brush Script MT is a gorgeous font and works great on my home computer, but on
                        my phone
                        and
                        chromebook, Brush Script MT isn't supported. That's why backup fonts are so important.
                        In the
                        event that someone viewing your thread isn't on a browser that supports the first font
                        you
                        pick, you should always list one or two and end it with a generic font-family such as
                        serif or
                        sans-serif. After
                        all, your thread with Brush Script MT headers would give off an entirely different vibe
                        to
                        someone
                        who the only cursive font their browser supports is Comic Sans (which is the case on my
                        chromebook).
                        Basically, just always have a second and third favorite in mind and add them on there
                        just to be
                        safe. The people who view your threads will be grateful for the extra work.</p>

                    <h4>Web Safe Fonts</h4>
                    <p>This refers to fonts that are commonly compatible across most browsers. Below I will give
                        an
                        example of every font listed on the w3schools page for web safe fonts and if any of them
                        look
                        the same as the name in parentheses, then that means your browser does not natively have
                        it.
                        This isn't a huge deal when it comes to CSS layouts, but is important to keep in mind
                        for HTML
                        templates and bio boxes since you cannot import a font on threads or lion bios. I will
                        also
                        include some notes I have from working with these fonts myself.</p>

                    <ul class="font-ex">
                        <li><span class="arial">Arial</span> (Arial): Not much to say here, it's Arial. Sleek
                            and
                            reliable.</li>
                        <li><span class="verdana">Verdana</span> (Verdana): <strong>I <em>love</em> this
                                one.</strong> A
                            nice neutral sans-serif and it's dyslexia friendly.</li>
                        <li><span class="tahoma">Tahoma</span> (Tahoma): My go-to after Verdana. Works great as
                            body
                            text if you feel Verdana is too spread out.</li>
                        <li><span class="trebuchet">Trebuchet MS</span> (Trebuchet MS): This one barely
                            counts as web safe to me since it's compatibility is pretty spotty across
                            browsers.</li>
                        <li><span class="times">Times New Roman</span> (Times New Roman): The classic, the OG if
                            you
                            will. I rarely use it since it makes me think of college. It is a good font, though.

                        <li><span class="georgia">Georgia</span> (Georgia): A fave for headers, but also great
                            for body
                            text.</li>
                        <li><span class="garamond">Garamond</span> (Garamond): Works best at a slightly larger
                            font size where body text is concerned.</strong></li>
                        <li><span class="courier">Courier New</span> (Courier New): I don't recommend this one
                            for large blocks of text.</li>
                        <li><span class="brush">Brush Script MT</span> (Brush Script MT): <strong>Only use this
                                font for
                                headers.</strong> If you use it at a small size, nobody will think it's fancy or
                            cute.
                            They will just
                            think it's annoying.</li>
                    </ul>
