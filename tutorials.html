                <h3 class="pb-2">Den Boxes</h3>
                <p>The den boxes found on my free CSS page already have the bulk of the styling done for you, but you'll
                    still need to add style information such as the background color, text color, and borders yourself.
                    There's already placeholder information for the background and text colors included, but you can
                    easily add more style information by adding more CSS properties to the style attribute.</p>
                <p>For example, if you wanted to change the default borders, you would add something like border: 1px
                    solid #333 onto the style information. You can do the same with anything else you want to change
                    about the boxes. You could also take the file that I have the default code in and duplicate and edit
                    however you like if you'd rather make changes with css as opposed to in the html. I recommend this
                    if you are already familiar with CSS as it will make it much easier to make quick changes. I find
                    that CSS files are easier to read from than the style attribute on an html element since there's
                    spacing between the CSS properties.</p>
                <p>You can find more info about styling HTML elements on w3schools and mdn web docs.</p>
                <h3 class="pb-2">HTML Templates</h3>
                <p>Do you want to make your own HTML template? Then this is the section for you! I will be including the
                    base template I use for all of my free ones that you are welcome to edit as much as you like. I just
                    ask that the credit section that links to my page remain intact as I am the one who coded the base.
                    By extension, I'd rather the base not be used for commissions or remixed into any further free
                    HTML.
                </p>
                <label for="htmlTemplate">Base Code</label>
                <textarea name="copy-field" id="htmlTemplate" rows="10" class="copy-field"></textarea>
                <p class="pt-3">When it comes to choosing a background image, it is much different from choosing an
                    image for a CSS
                    layout. In this case, smaller is better. What you'll want for the best results I've found is a
                    small, smoothly repeatable image. I find that the best places to find those are through fabric
                    stores (I usually look at cotton fabrics since they have the widest array of options typically) and
                    pattern generaters. Since you <em>shouldn't</em> be using these for commissions, there's less to
                    worry about when it comes to things like copyright, but generally you should avoid anything that is
                    copyrighted material anyway in my experience. Simple repeating patterns with only one or two main
                    colors are typically the easiest to work with. From there, you'll just need to screenshot the
                    portion you want repeated, resize it down a bit if necessary, host it somewhere, and then it's ready
                    to be
                    linked as your background image.</p>
                <p>That's really the toughest part of making a template. The rest is just the repetitive process of
                    replacing any of the colors, fonts, and borders with what you want, which can become second nature
                    once you've gotten the hang of it. Some good resources to check for that process would be on
                    w3schools if you're still pretty new and mdn web docs if you've got some experience and don't mind
                    doing some extra reading into everythig you can do.</p>
                <p>Although, it's also important to keep in mind how fonts work on Lioden forums. You can't import any
                    fonts onto your threads, so your best bet is to stick to what are called Web Safe Fonts. But
                    choosing a web safe font still doesn't guarantee it'll work for everyone who views your thread. For
                    example, Brush Script MT is a gorgeous font and works great on my home computer, but on my phone and
                    chromebook, Brush Script MT isn't a supported font. That's why backup fonts are so important. In the
                    event that someone viewing your thread might not be on abrowser that supports the first font you
                    pick, you should always list one or two and end it with a generic such as serif or sans-serif. After
                    all, your thread with Brush Script MT headers would give off an entirely different vibe to someone
                    who the only cursive font their browser supports is Comic Sans (which is the case on my chromebook).
                    Basically, just always have a second and third favorite in mind and add them on there just to be
                    safe. The people who view your threads will be grateful for the extra work.</p>
