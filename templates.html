        <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: these templates are for forums only, so do not use in your den bios. They will overlap weird with the comment box. If you want den boxes, go to the den box section at the bottom of the <a href="./index.html">CSS page</a>. Anything to do with dens will be on the CSS page. Only forum stuff will be on this page.</p>
        <h4>Rules:</h4>
        <ul class="ms-2 pe-5">
            <li><strong>No redistributing.</strong> This means no editing them for your friends, using for commissions or free HTML, or otherwise sharing the code by any way other than pointing them either to the home thread or this site directly.</li>
            <li><strong>No credit removal.</strong> My credits need to remain intact no matter what. I made the base for these templates myself and I expect anyone who uses that base to respect the time I put into it and my choice to share them. I do not need to let these remain available.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not share to people I have blocked.</strong> It shouldn't need to be said, but if I have blocked somebody I do not want them to be able to interact with anything of mine as that is a gross invasion of privacy. Please respect my boundaries just as you want yours to be respected.</li>
            <li>Outside of the rules outlined previously, you may edit these templates as much as you please. If you are struggling with anything, <strong>consult the tutorials page first</strong>, and if you are still unable to figure something out, you may message me. I am pretty busy these days, but I will try to help you as best I can.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How to Use:</h4>
        <ol class="ms-2 pe-5">
            <li>Copy the Code</li>
            <li>Paste it into your forum</li>
            <li>Replace placeholder text with whatever you'd like and/or replace, remove, or duplicate sections as needed</li>
            <li>That's it! I tried my best to make this as user friendly as I could since I know looking at walls of HTML can be very intimidating if you're new to it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I do not do HTML commissions and whether or not I accept any requests is pretty iffy since it's hard to find the kinda BGs I want a lot of the time, unfortunately. You're welcome to ask of course, but I can't guarantee anything.</p>
